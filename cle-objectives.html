                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study shows that at least 12-18 year olds are diagnosed with depression, although, it can happen to anyone. 
                                Our objective is to prevent teens from committing suicide or be aware of fellow peers who suffer from such. <br><br><font size="6">Here is a list of our objectives: </font>
                                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· The <font size="5">first objective</font> is that we should include suicide prevention as a core component of health care services. Our mental health is just as important as our physical health. Alongside other health care services, they should include free therapy for teens or young children who are suspected to be depressed. 
                                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· The <font size="5">second objective</font> is implement research-informed communication efforts designed to prevent suicide by changing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. A lot of teen suffer from depression because of various things such as anxiety, peer pressure, sexuality concerns, a bad home life among many others. Someone who suffers from depression is more unlikely to talk about it. If a teen is suspected to be depressed and refuses to talk about it, the school guidance office or a mental health professional to encourage the teen to confide in them.
                                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· The <font size="5">last objective</font> is increase knowledge of the factors that offer protection from suicidal behaviors and that promote wellness and recovery. Someone who suffers from depression have a tendency to think about killing themselves to rid of the suffering they’re enduring. Some teens keep to themselves these thoughts while some play it off as “dark humor”. If the school or a concerned parent or anybody at all sees such behavior in a teen, they should be given a gentle talk and convince them to not go through with their plan. They should keep an eye on said teen and prevent them from finding ways to commit suicide.</p>
